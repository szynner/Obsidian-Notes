## Types of Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two values.
- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts one value from another.
- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two values.
- **Division (`/`)**: Divides one value by another.
- **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of a division.

### Assignment Operators

- **Assign (`=`)**: Assigns value from right to left.
- **Add and Assign (`+=`)**: Adds right operand to left operand and assign the result to left.
- **Subtract and Assign (`-=`)**: Similar to `+=`, but for subtraction.
- **Multiply and Assign (`*=`)**, etc.

### Comparison Operators

- **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if two values are equal.
- **Not Equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if two values are not equal.
- **Greater Than (`>`)**: Checks if left is greater than right.
- **Less Than (`<`)**: Checks if left is less than right.
- **Greater Than or Equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if left is greater than or equal to right.
- **Less Than or Equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if left is less than or equal to right.

### Logical Operators

- **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Returns true if both operands are true.
- **Logical OR (`||`)**: Returns true if at least one operand is true.
- **Logical NOT (`!`)**: Inverts the value of a boolean.

### Bitwise Operators

- **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: Performs a bitwise AND operation.
- **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: Performs a bitwise OR operation.
- **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: Performs a bitwise XOR operation.
- **Bitwise Complement (`~`)**: Inverts the bits of a number.
- **Shift Operators (`<<`, `>>`, `>>>`)**: Shift bits left or right.

### Increment/Decrement Operators

- **Increment (`++`)**: Increases the value of a variable by 1.
- **Decrement (`--`)**: Decreases the value of a variable by 1.

### Ternary Operator

- **Ternary (`? :`)**: Short form for if-else statement.

## Examples
```java
int a = 10, b = 5; int sum = a + b; 
// 15 int difference = a - b; 
// 5 boolean isEqual = (a == b); 
// false a++; // a becomes 11`
```
